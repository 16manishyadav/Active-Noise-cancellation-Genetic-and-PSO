# Active-Noise-cancellation-Genetic-and-PSO
In the project, I developed genetic and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms for active noise cancellation. The objective was to design efficient algorithms that could effectively cancel out unwanted noise in various environments. The genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the coefficients of the adaptive filter, while the PSO algorithm was utilized to enhance the convergence speed and solution quality. Through extensive experimentation and fine-tuning, the algorithms demonstrated their capability to significantly reduce noise levels and improve the overall sound quality. This project showcased my expertise in algorithm design and signal processing techniques for noise cancellation applications.
